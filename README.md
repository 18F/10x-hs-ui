# 10x-workshare

## Overview of short-time compensation
For this 10x, the team has decided to focus on short-time compensation (STC), also referred to as work-share. 

STC is a form of unemployment insurance (UI) that gives employers the option of reducing employees’ hours instead of cutting their workforce during a business slowdown. For example, a business may determine it needs to reduce personnel costs by laying off five employees until business improves. Under work-sharing, the employer could instead reduce the hours of 25 employees by 20 percent, and those workers would receive a pro-rated UI payment for their one day per week of unemployment, while maintaining any existing health and retirement benefits. By opting for work-sharing, the business is able to operate during a downturn without losing valued employees and is better positioned to ramp back up when economic conditions improve.

The CARES Act provides federal funding for 100% of STC paid by states with programs already in place<sup>1</sup> and $100 million in grants to help states in implementing and administering STC programs<sup>2</sup> for three years.

With 11.1% of the population – or 17.8 million people – currently unemployed, (a 12 million increase since February) the need for STC to help ease the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on employers and employees has never been higher<sup>3</sup>. Unfortunately, state workers are overwhelmed by the volume of UI and STC claims and necessary manual reviews and workflow. The use of STC has historically been relatively low (at its peak in 2010, the ratio of STC beneficiaries to regular unemployment compensation beneficiaries was 3%<sup>4</sup>) due lack of awareness of the program, administrative complexity for employers, and employer costs. This project intends to dig in on these processes and experiences to find opportunities for improvement. 

## History of STC
Work sharing has a decades-long history in the United States. For example, in the early 1930s, President Hoover encouraged employers to reduce employees’ hours instead of laying them off. In 1932, the President’s Organization on Unemployment Relief issued a report that concluded, “Reduction in the working time is the principal method of spreading employment” through such means as reduced days per week, reduced hours per day, or rotating time off. 

New York was the first state to consider STC legislation, in 1975, as part of a broader employment policy bill. The legislation died in committee.

In 1978, California became the first state to enact an STC law. 

The federal government introduced a temporary, national STC program in 1982 with the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA; P.L. 97-248), which expired in 1985. The U.S. DOL did not curtail the program’s operation in existing states, nor did it stop new states from adopting the program. 

The recession of 1990-1991 brought renewed attention to STC, leading Congress to enact permanent STC legislation, the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 (UCA; P.L. 102-318). However, at the time, government officials argued that the 1992 law was restrictive in application and would have put many existing state STC programs out of compliance and required clarification.

Congress passed federal legislation in 2012 – Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 (UCA, P.L. 102-318) – that set national program standards and offered federal grants to states for implementing new programs, improving the operational efficiency of existing programs, and promoting enrollment and marketing of STC to employers and workers. 

The CARES Act, Section 2108, allows for states with STC programs in place to receive 100% reimbursement of STC payments and 50% federal financing for states that set up STC, available through December 31, 2020. Section 2110 allows $100 million in grants to states, 1/3 for the purpose of implementation or improved administration of such programs and 2/3 for promotion and enrollment; requests must be submitted by December 31, 2020<sup>5</sup>.

## Benefits of STC

### Employer benefits
* Retain their current, skilled workforce while reducing hours and wages.
* Eliminate the time and expense of recruiting and training new employees when business needs increase.
* Improve morale; even employees who survive a layoff may be vulnerable to “survivor’s guilt” and emotional contagion (picking up on the despair of laid-off employees) that can reduce productivity<sup>6</sup>.

### Employee benefits
* Avoid the hardship of full unemployment and being permanently laid off.
* Retain connection with their current employer and remain ready when times and business gets better.
* Not required to look for other work.
* Do not need to train for a new job.
* Earn a portion of their regular wages while receiving a portion of UI benefits to replace the portion of their wages lost (generally, employees will make more with STC than with only UI). 
* Maintain health and retirement benefits.

### State benefits
* Reduce unemployment rates.
* CARES Act federal funding for STC payments and grants to help implement and administer STC programs. 

### Economic benefits
* Saves jobs; more than 500,000 in the U.S. from 2008-2013<sup>7</sup>.
* Keeps employment stable to avoid financial crises<sup>8</sup>. 

> “The benefits are enormous. We preserve valued employee talent and experience, while workers maintain fringe benefits and employment status with a minor differential in pay in the form of pro-rated unemployment insurance. We did not lay off a single worker during the downturn and ramped back up easily when business returned to its former levels. In addition, there has been a tremendous payoff in employee morale that comes from committing to the company’s workforce during tough times. And, of course, having fully trained workers when the business cycle turns up really does translate into a competitive advantage<sup>9</sup>.” 

## Opportunity areas to explore
* Currently, 27 states have STC programs established in law that meet the new federal definition with 26 having operational programs<sup>10</sup>. Other states, and their workforce, would benefit from having STC laws passed.
* Administration of these programs is time-consuming for state employees and employers who, oftentimes, rely on paper processes.
* Most states are trying to heavily-modify COTS software to administer STC, which can lead to high expense, long implementation timelines, and vendor lock-in.
* Awareness of these programs is relatively low and there is federal grant funding available through CARES Act to help improve their awareness/usage.
