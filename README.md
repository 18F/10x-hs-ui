# 10x-workshare

## Overview of short-time compensation
For this 10x, the team has decided to focus on short-time compensation (STC), also referred to as work-share. 

STC is a form of unemployment insurance (UI) that gives employers the option of reducing employees’ hours instead of cutting their workforce during a business slowdown. For example, a business may determine it needs to reduce personnel costs by laying off five employees until business improves. Under work-sharing, the employer could instead reduce the hours of 25 employees by 20 percent, and those workers would receive a pro-rated UI payment for their one day per week of unemployment, while maintaining any existing health and retirement benefits. By opting for work-sharing, the business is able to operate during a downturn without losing valued employees and is better positioned to ramp back up when economic conditions improve.

The CARES Act provides federal funding for 100% of STC paid by states with programs already in place <sup>1</sup> and $100 million in grants to help states in implementing and administering STC programs <sup>2</sup> for three years.

With 11.1% of the population – or 17.8 million people – currently unemployed, (a 12 million increase since February) the need for STC to help ease the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on employers and employees has never been higher <sup>3</sup>. Unfortunately, state workers are overwhelmed by the volume of UI and STC claims and necessary manual reviews and workflow. The use of STC has historically been relatively low (at its peak in 2010, the ratio of STC beneficiaries to regular unemployment compensation beneficiaries was 3%) due lack of awareness of the program, administrative complexity for employers, and employer costs. This project intends to dig in on these processes and experiences to find opportunities for improvement.
